### Year 9 IST Formative Assessment

I made this when I was 15 in high school during our Information Software and Technology class. 
This was my first proper attempt at an HTML site. 
There was better scrolling and stickiness of elements, but somewhere along the way in the past 7 years those features have broken.

I'm keeping this up to remind me where I came from.


Fun fact: I crashed the 2007 Dell Optiplexes in the school library whilst trying to animate the 'Easy Cheese' advert
